# CodeGymTasks

 CodeGym mini project - level 39 - Cash Mashine

Task objectives:

Let's write an ATM emulator.

We will support the following operations:<br>
deposit money, withdraw money, and show the status of the ATM.<br>
We will also support multiple currencies.<br>
The ATM will operate using the banknotes we put into it.<br>
If there are insufficient banknotes to make a withdrawal, then we will inform the user.<br>
Obviously, everything should be user friendly, so you'll have to arrange things just right.
